    "# Pandas UDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Normal\" Python UDFs are pretty expensive (in terms of execution time), since for every record the following steps need to be performed:\n",
    "* record is serialized inside JVM\n",
    "* record is sent to an external Python process\n",
    "* record is deserialized inside Python\n",
    "* record is Processed in Python\n",
    "* result is serialized in Python\n",
    "* result is sent back to JVM\n",
    "* result is deserialized and stored inside result DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not only sound like a lot of work, it actually is. Therefore Python UDFs are a magnitude slower than native UDFs written in Scala or Java, which run directly inside the JVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since Spark 2.3 an alternative approach is available for defining Python UDFs with so called *Pandas UDFs*. Pandas is a commonly used Python framework which also offers DataFrames (but Pandas DataFrames, not Spark DataFrames). Spark 2.3 now can convert inside the JVM a Spark DataFrame into a shareable memory buffer by using a library called *Arrow*. Python then can also treat this memory buffer as a Pandas DataFrame and can directly work on this shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has two major advantages:\n",
    "* No need for serialization and deserialization, since data is shared directly in memory between the JVM and Python\n",
    "* Pandas has lots of very efficient implementations in C for many functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these two facts, Pandas UDFs are much faster and should be preferred over traditional Python UDFs whenever possible."
