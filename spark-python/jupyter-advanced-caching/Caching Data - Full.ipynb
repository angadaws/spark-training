    "# Caching Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark offers the possibility to cache data, which means that it tries to keep (intermediate) results either in memory or on disk. This can be very helpful in iterative algorithms or interactive analysis, where you want to prevent that the same processing steps are performed over and over again.\n",

    "### Approach to Caching\n",
    "Instead of performing timings of individual executions, we use the `explain()` method again to see how output changes with cached intermediate results.\n",
